# hello-world

My name is Bruce Alderfer and I am rookie web developer living in Skippack Township, Pennsylvania.

I am becoming proficient in HTML 5 and CSS 3, and I have been learning jQuery and Bootstrap. My goal is to learn JavaScript shortly.

In my day job, I am the Executive Producer for 6abc.com in Philadelphia.

There I work with a team of producers to deliver the best possible content on our website, our apps and our social media platforms.

This page is built using HTML 5, CSS 3, and Bootstrap.
